      <h2>Impressionism</h2>
      <q class="move-quote" cite="">Not Just as they are, but how they appear to be</q><br>
      <small>-Frederick Wedmore</small>
      <p>For Centuries, the Catholic church and visual arts were closely intertwined. For much of the 19th century, more value was place on art thar minced the style of the ancient Greek and Roman artwork of the renaissance. This meant that painting were to be bold, well defined, dramatic and inspired by religion and history.</p>

      <p>It is impossible to pin point the exact moment when the impressionism movement began, however, the 1863 Paris Salon is considered a key turning point. That year roughly two thirds of painting were rejected from the exhibition which Inspired a parody Salon title Salon des Refusés (The Exhibition of Rejects). This exhibition legitimized artwork that didn’t center around themes of religion and history but more so the mundane moments in all our lives.</p>

      <p>Impressionism Focused on capturing city-scapes and the industrialization. Light Played an Important role in many impressionist works, specially how light interacted with the subject matter.</p>

      <h2>Fauvism</h2>
      <q class="move-quote" cite="©">The More abstract is form, the more clear and direct is it’s appeal</q><br>
      <small>- Wassily Kaninky</small>
      <p>Seen as a reaction to the explosion of Impressionism, Fauvism came into fruition in the early 20th century. The movement gained it’s unusual name from critic Louis Vauxcelles who described the artist involved in the movement as “Les Fauves” which translate to “Wild Beasts”.</p>
      <p>Fauvist reject the idea of realistic values and used the colours they wanted to use. In the roughly 40 years since the beginning of the Impressionist movement, Fauvism unravelled the idea that a painting should exclusively represent the modern world. </p>

      <h2>Futurism</h2>
      <q class="move-quote" cite="">We shall sing the great masses shaken with work, pleasure, or rebellion</q><br>
      <small>- Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</small>
      <p>Inspired by Italian poet and philosopher Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Futurism focused on rejecting the existing art scene. Tommaso wanted Italy to become the epicentre of progress by riding itself of all archaic institutions such as museums and libraries. The Futurist movement focused on speed and power. Painting from this time idealized industrialization and war.</p>

      <h2>Surrealism</h2>
      <q class="move-quote" cite="André breton">In the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern</q><br>
      <small>- André breton</small>
      <p>Originating in Europe in the years following World War One and leading up to World War Two, Surrealism was viewed not as an escape from life but as a force within it. The word Surrealism originated from the writings of Guillaume Apollinaire. For him, Surrealism was a product of the human imagination freed from imitating nature. Surrealism was heavily influenced by other art movements like Dada as both sought to disown traditions and the institution that lead to war. But there Surrealism separates itself from Dada is how it goes about rejecting said practices. Surrealist did not just want to disrupt the modern world, they wanted to re-invent it.</p>

      <p>As World War Two began, many of the surrealist artist fled to New York City, USA, and began forming connections with the American artists. This lead to an explosion of far more controversial movements.</p>

      <h2>Abstract Expressionism</h2>
      <q class="move-quote" cite="Woldgang Paalen">Paintings no longer represent… Today it has become the role of the painting to look at the spectator and ask him: what do you represent?</q><br>
      <small>– Woldgang Paalen</small>
      <p>As World War Two made its way across Europe, many Surrealist and other artist moved to New York City, USA, many American artist created their own movements as a reaction to the Europeans counterparts, the most well known being Abstract Expressionism.</p>

      <p>The artist involved in this movement made work that was deeply personal, inventive and confrontational. Prior to the creation of Abstract Expressionism, much of America viewed Abstract art as nonsensical and worthless. They considered it as a strictly European style and had little respect for it. However, once American born artist started making their own abstract art, public opinion changed rapidly.</p>

      <p>Much of the Success of the Abstract Expression movement can be credited to German Immigrant, Peggy Guggenhuim. After Settling in in New York City, USA, Peggy hosted a number of exhibitions; introducing the American public to these European art styles.  She also Played a role in the success of American Abstract expressionist, Jackson pollock.</p>

      <p>Though Abstract Expressionism was popular among some artist, the movement faceda lot of backlash. The American art world was still deeply conservative and wasuncomfortable with the subjective and provocative works of the movements.</p>
