      <p class="intro-p">Many of us have been to at least one art gallery in our lifetime. We know the what it is like to wade through a room decorated with detailed portraits of people lounging around in extravagate clothing. It is safe to say that most of us consider artist such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci “Real Artists”. Then you wander into another area of the gallery and are confronted by Barnett Newmans’ 18ft tall Voice of fire or Jackson Pollock’s Autumn Rhythm, number 30. Though both paintings are featured in world renowned galleries; chances are you’d be able to find someone who doesn’t believe that its “real art”. In less than 100 years, how did art movements such as realism lead us to styles like abstract expressionism? And wht don't people consider modern art "real art"?</p>
